SDCT-AuxNet$^\theta$: DCT Augmented Stain Deconvolutional CNN with Auxiliary Classifier for Cancer Diagnosis is an architecture developed for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell classification. The architecture employs a small CNN boosted with domain-specific initial layers and a novel ensembling approach. The ensemble approach utilizes two different classifiers coupled with a user-defined variable. The ensembling approach is very generic and can be easily extended to any classification architecture. The dataset used is publicly available at  <a href="
