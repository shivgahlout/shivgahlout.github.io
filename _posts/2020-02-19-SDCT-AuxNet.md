In this post, we will discuss our recently published paper: SDCT-AuxNet$^\theta$: DCT Augmented Stain
Deconvolutional CNN with Auxiliary Classifier for Cancer Diagnosis. The architecture is developed for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell classification. The architcture employs a small CNN boosted with domain specific initial layers and a novel ensembling approach. The ensemble approach utilizes two different classifiers coupled through a user defined variable. The ensembling approach is very generic and can be easily extended to any classification architecture. The dataset used is publicly available at  <a href="
