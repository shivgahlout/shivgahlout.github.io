GCTI-SN is a Geometry-inspired Chemical-invariant and Tissue Invariant Stain Normalization method. The proposed GCTI-SN method corrects for 
illumination variation, stain chemical, and stain quantity variation in a unified framework by exploiting the underlying color vector 
spaceâ€™s geometry. While existing stain normalization methods have demonstrated their results on a single tissue and stain type, GCTI-SN 
is benchmarked on three cancer datasets of three cell/tissue types prepared with two different stain chemicals. the utility and the efficacy 
of the GCTI-SN stain normalization method is demonstrated diagnostically in the application of breast cancer detection via a CNN-based classifier.
