EDNFC-Net is a CNN based architecture for nuclei-instance segmentation. The architecture utilizes a fundamental building block called FCC and uses intra-FCC as well as inter-FCC features concatenation. The architecture is trained with a loss function that encourages better foreground and background separation.
