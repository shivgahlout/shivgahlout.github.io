This challenges was organized as a part of The IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)-2019 conference. It was a collaborative 
work of [SBILab, IIIT-Delhi](http://sbilab.iiitd.edu.in/) and [Laboratory Oncology Unit, AIIMS, New-Delhi](https://www.aiims.edu/en/laboratory-oncology.html).

**Aim: Classification of leukemic B-lymphoblast cells from normal B-lymphoid precursors from blood smear microscopic images.**
In this challenge, a dataset of cells with labels (normal versus malignant) was be provided to train machine learning based classifier to 
identify normal cells from leukemic blasts (malignant cells). These cells were segmented from the images after stain normalization. 
The  methods developed by participants were compared using weighted F1 performance metric. The leaderboard of this challenge is till open and submssions can be made to evaluate the performance on the test set. \

This challenge is being organized as a part of The IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)-2021 conference. It is a collaborative 
work of [SBILab, IIIT-Delhi](http://sbilab.iiitd.edu.in/) and [Laboratory Oncology Unit, AIIMS, New-Delhi](https://www.aiims.edu/en/laboratory-oncology.html).

**Aim: Segmentation of cells' (nucleus+cytoplasm) instances from multiple myeloma microscopic images.**
This challenge is foucssed on cell instance segmentation. The problem is challenging as it involves whole cell (nucleus+cytoplasm) segmentation. Also, cell instance 
segmentation is challenging when cells are clustered. \
